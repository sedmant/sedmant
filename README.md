<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ilya, aka sedmant.</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am a student who has tried several dozen programming languages and does not know any of them well.</h3>

I've always been passionate about computers and programming. I am currently learning **[C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp)**, **[ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet)** and a few other things related to web development in order to have at least some tools that I would know well and that I could rely on. 

<p align="center">
   Fun fact: I still haven't learned English.
